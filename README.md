# ToDo App

A simple storefront app with a focus on React & Redux. The focus of this project is to deepen my understanding of Redux and global state management via reducers & `combineReducers`.

[Deployed App](kmdev-storefront.netlify.app)

## Problem Domain
Create an app that mocks an e-commerce storefront.

The user should be able to add items to a cart as well as remove them.

The user should be able to edit/modify the quantities of the items that exist within the cart.

The user should NOT be able to add items to the cart if they are out of stock.
